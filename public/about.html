<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I started learning web development in May 2025 as a way to expand my horizons for coding and creativity as
 well as a possible career change. Only having a bit of knowledge of coding games in GameMaker Studio (which resembles C++), 
 I was able to catch on to web development pretty easily. I enjoy coding! It's amazing to start off with nothing and watch 
 it come to life!

I'm a quick learner when it comes to picking up something new. I also try editing videos for tabletop games on 
YouTube as well as music. I play guitar fairly well and have a sense of writing material, though I don't have a lot to show. 
Photography is something else I've tried out. Did several shoots for the family and their special occasions. I want to continue 
to learn new skills that can break through my limitations of my creativity to one day make something beautiful.
