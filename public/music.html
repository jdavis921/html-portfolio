<h1> The Best Songs to Listen to With Heavy Elements</h1>
<h2>My top 3 songs I enjoy that are mostly calm but ramps up in the end</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Mend You by Times of Grace</h3>
<p>
    This song is about wanting to help someone who's struggling with life, which we all have been there 
    some way, shape, or form. It starts off simple and melodically till it gets close to the end where the 
    group goes all in with some powerful vocals and guitar playing to really sell the meaning of the
    song.

<h3>Instrumental by War of Ages</h3>
<p>
    This is perhaps one of my instrumentals I heard. It starts off with a somber sounding melody that 
    has an electric guitar come in and do a melodic lead. As the song progresses, the rest of the
    band comes in to blow the listener away.

<h3>Full Moon Full Life by Lotus Juice</h3>
<p>
    If you are familiar with the Persona series, you know they don't play around with music.
    This song starts off with a bop vibe. Then, out of nowhere, pre-chorus kicks in with guitar and Lotus Juice
    rapping leading to an explosive chorus. If you played Persona 3 Reload, this was the title song for the game.
